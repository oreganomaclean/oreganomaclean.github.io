    <h1>Where have I been?</h1>
    <p>If you've stumbled upon this page, it is because you are interested in adventure and exploration. 
      I have been able to go all around the world discovering more about myself and everywhere around me. Come along for the ride!
    At the moment, I have been able to travel to 19 countries (20 if you include Canada) over 4 continents! Have you been to any of the same countries? </p>
